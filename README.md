## Logistic Regression Project
This project showcases my skills in data analysis and machine learning, specifically focusing on logistic regression. The project involves using logistic regression to analyze and predict outcomes based on the provided dataset.

## Project Overview
The Logistic Regression Project aims to build a logistic regression model to understand the relationship between the features and the target variable in the dataset. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, model building, and evaluation.

## Analysis and Visualizations
In this project, I performed the following analyses and visualizations:

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
 - Correlation analysis to understand relationships between features and the target variable.
 - Distribution plots and scatter plots to visualize data patterns.
3. Model Building and Evaluation:
 - Building a logistic regression model using training data.
 - Evaluating the model using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and the ROC curve.
## Results
Some of the key findings from the analysis include:

- Correlation Analysis: Identified features that have a strong correlation with the target variable.
- Model Performance: The logistic regression model's performance was evaluated, providing insights into its predictive power and accuracy.
